# GoldBadgeChallenges

In order to progress with the Eleven Fifty program we were assigned a list of challenges and were required to complete three.

Each challenge is a console application demonstrating proficiency in C#

# Challenge One: CafeApp

This console application shows an understanding of being able to store, manipulate, and manage data.
The application simulates what a restaurant owner might use to update their menu. User can add, search, and delete menu items.

# Challenge Two: ClaimsApp

This console application uses a Queue that allows users to cycle through insurance claims. User can view claims, add claim, and deal with 'next' claim.
