# GoldBadgeChallenges

In order to progress with the Eleven Fifty program we were assigned a list of challenges and were required to complete three.

Each challenge is a console application demonstrating proficiency in C#, manipulating databases, and object oriented programming.

# Challenge One: CafeApp

This console application shows an understanding of being able to store, manipulate, and manage data.
The application simulates what a restaurant owner might use to update their menu. User can add, search, and delete menu items.

# Challenge Two: ClaimsApp

This console application uses a Queue that allows users to cycle through insurance claims. User can view claims, add claim, and deal with 'next' claim.
Claims can be stored and removed.

# Challenge Three: OutingsApp

This console application simulates a user who might be in charge of tracking expenses on company outings. User is able to view a list of all outings, they're total cost, cost per person, and amount of people who attended. The user can add new outings and view total cost of all outings as well as total cost of all outings by category.
